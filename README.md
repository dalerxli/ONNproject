# ONNproject
Code for designing and running an optical neural network

The last two programs are mostly a compilation of the other programs
test_neural_network_input.py - this tries to read the display using one or two threshold values for the images
test_neural_netowrk_input_2.py - this tries to read the display using different values for each of the points on the display aka using a threshold array
